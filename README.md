## Insights
### What was your motivation?
To have one page for hiring managers to look for information about me and find evidence of my ability to learn new things. It showcases my best work. Having a portfolio will 
also help my own confidence to grow.
### Why did you build this project?
At the time I wrote this project I was just starting to try and get my work out there so I could get an internship and start my career.
### What problem does it solve?
It solves the problem of hiring managers not being able to find sufficient evidence to have motivation to bring me onto their team.
### What did you learn?
I learned to take a project from a paper design, to a vanilla MVP project, to a framework. I practiced git, learned react, markdown, and helped me realize how much work could be done to 
make my projects more outsider friendly.
### What makes your project stand out? 
It is simple and easy to find the information you need.
